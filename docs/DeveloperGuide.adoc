By: `Daniel, Jun Quan, Conant, Bing Hwang`      Since: `Jun 2016`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.md[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Design

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 2.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

=== UI component

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component. This diagram shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 2.3.1_

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model component

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

=== Storage component

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book. +
**Pros:** Easy to implement. +
**Cons:** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself. +
**Pros:** Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Type of commands that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`). +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands. +
**Pros:** Might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

=== Email mechanism

The email mechanism is facilitated by java `Desktop` class which allows java application to launch default mail client registered on the users' native desktop to handle a Uniform Resource Indentifier `URI`.
In this case, the link:#uri[URI] created is a reference to the mail command scheme and email addresses to mail to.

==== Email command implementation

image::3.2.1 Email Command Implementation.png[width="800"]

pass:[<div align="center"><b>Figure 3.2.1 Email Command Implementation</b></div>]

From the diagram above, when users enter the command `email 1` to email a person in their address book.
`EmailCommandParser` will parse the arguments, which are either a single index or multiple indices, provided by the users and store them
in an array called `targetIndices` and return a `EmailCommand`. Next, `EmailCommand` will call its method `execute()`
and ensure that `Index` specified is valid and construct a String `allEmaillAddress` which contains all the email addresses. Refer to code example below: +

* Code listing:
+
[source, java]
-------------
        // Do others in EmailCommand.execute()
        // StringBuilder helps to append the email addresses of each person
        StringBuilder addresses = new StringBuilder();
        for (Index targetIndex : targetIndices) {
            // Throws exception if target index is out of bounds
        }
            addresses.append(" ");
            addresses.append(personToEmail.getEmail().toString());
        }
// Add a comma between all email addresses
String allEmailAddresses = addresses.toString().trim().replaceAll(" ", ",");
// Return a CommandResult
EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new EmailRequestEvent(allEmailAddresses));
return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_EMAIL_PERSON_SUCCESS, allPersons));
-------------
[NOTE]
The String `allEmailAddresses` is constructed by appending a comma after each email address of a contact. This is done to ensure that it follows the syntax required when
constructing a `URI`.

==== Email request event process

image::3.2.1 Email Request Event Process.png[width="800"]

pass:[<div align="center"><b>Figure 3.2.2 Email Request Event Process</b></div>]

With reference to the diagram above, after `EmailCommand` has executed, it will post a new `EmailRequestEvent` and allow the UI to handle this event. In the UI, we are using java `Desktop` class to
launch the default mail client registered on users' native desktop. A `URI` instance have to be created and pass to the mail method in the `Desktop` class.
Refer to the code example below: +

* Code listing:
+
[source, java]
--------------
private staic final String EMAIL_URI_PREFIX = "mailTo:";

// Do others in MainWindow

URI mailTo = new URI(EMAIL_URI_PREFIX + allEmailAddresses);
    // Checks if Desktop class is supported
    if (Desktop.isDesktopSupported()) {
        Desktop userDesktop = Desktop.getDesktop();
        userDesktop.mail(mailTo);
    } else {
        // Throws Execepton
    }
--------------

[NOTE]
To construct a valid `URI` instance, the scheme `EMAIL_URI_PREFIX` which specifies the operation to launch user's default mail client must be
followed by the String `allEmailAddresses`.

Lastly, users' desktop will launch a default mail client where they can compose the subject and message body of the email.
Moreover, users can also edit their recipients field to include carbon copy or blind carbon copy before sending out
the email to their recipients.

==== Design consideration
**Aspect:** Type of application to send emails +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use user's default mail client +
**Pros:** Default mail client tend to load faster than the default browser `WebView` used by `UI`: `BrowserPanel`. +
**Cons:** Does not support some operating systems such as Linux. +
**Alternative 2:** Use web browser to access user email services online. +
**Pros:** Able to support more users to use this email feature as there are more options for different users. +
**Cons:** Not all users use the same email services such as Gmail or Outlook. Moreover,
it is difficult to authorize every email services for all users since it is often dependent
on the type of email services they need. +

=== Import mechanism

The import mechanism is facilitated by Google's People API. It supports reading contacts from the user's personal Google account and parsing them into a format that can be added to the address book. The import mechanism only supports
adding contacts from Google but iCloud import is scheduled for release in a later version of the application.

Before any importing can be done, the address book has to be authorized to request data from Google's API. This is done using the OAuth 2.0 protocol as it is the standard used by Google for all of their APIs.
As there are libraries from Google that make authorization easier, these libraries have been used in the implementation of the import mechanism.

Client information such as the Client ID and Client secret are first loaded into a GoogleClientSecrets object. After which, A GoogleAuthorizationCodeFlow object is set up
using the GoogleClientSecrets, HttpTransport, JsonFactory objects and the scope of access desired to the user's Google Contacts data. In this implementation, we have chosen read-only as we are only importing
contacts and no modification to the data on Google's side will be performed. A AuthorizationCodeInstalledApp object is then created using the previously mentioned GoogleAuthorizationCodeFlow object, and also a LocalServerReceiver object which allows the application to listen on the local
web server for the authorization code that is provided when the user gives consent to access his/her data.

After which, the authorization flow can finally begin. The following sequence diagram illustrates this process.

image::https://developers.google.com/accounts/images/webflow.png[width="377"]
(Diagram from: https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2, reused under Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License)

A token is first requested by the AuthorizationCodeInstalledApp object, and a page for the user to login to his/her Google account is shown in the System's default web browser.
Once the user provides consent for the address book to access the data, an authorization code is sent back to the local web server where it is received by the LocalServerReceiver object and passed onto the GoogleAuthorizationCodeFlow
object so that the code can be exchanged for a token. Once the token is received, a Credential object is created and returned to the executeUndoableCommand method.

The Credential object is then passed to a `retrieveContacts` method that creates a `PeopleService` object that allows the application to interact with Google's People API.
The parameters used to get the list of the user's connections (Google's term for contacts) are as follows:

----
PageSize: 1000
PersonFields: Names, EmailAddresses, PhoneNumbers
----

A PageSize (the number of connections to fetch) of 1000 is chosen as it is the amount of contacts that the address book should be able to hold before it gets sluggish.
The PersonFields chosen are the ones most relevant to storing a contact, and more fields such as addresses will be added in future updates.

`retrieveContacts` will then pass the `List<Person>` of connections back to the caller and finally, a `importContacts` method will be called on the `List<Person>`.


The `importContacts` method is implemented using the `Task` class from JavaFX and takes care of importing contacts to the address book. `importContacts` is run in a separate `Thread` from the main program.
It parses every connection from the `List<Person>` using a `convertPerson` method that converts a `Person` object to a `seedu.address.model.person.Person` such that it can be added to the address book.
A progress bar for importing is also shown to the user, implemented using the `progressProperty()` method of the `Task` class.



The following sequence diagram shows how the import operation works:

image::ImportSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The import mechanism is built upon an `UndoableCommand`, which means that any changes made by the command can be easily reversed by calling the
`undo` command.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** How import executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Individually adds each contact. +
**Pros:** User is able to see each contact being added. +
**Cons:** Slower than adding retrieved contacts all at once as the data has to be written to disk every time a contact is added individually +
**Alternative 2:** Contacts are only added after every single `Person` is parsed +
**Pros:** Faster than adding as soon as each `Person` is parsed as data is written all at once, instead of multiple times +
**Cons:** Requires a new method `addAllInList` to be implemented in model, which only has limited use as import is the only command doing a batch
addition of contacts

---

**Aspect:** How import progress is shown to the user +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Show a pop-up progress window indicating how many contacts have been added +
**Pros:** Intuitive for the user to understand +
**Cons:** Difficult to implement as importing contacts takes a (relatively) long time and thus, blocks the JavaFX thread from updating the UI in a timely manner. As such, the progress bar will not be updated until the `importContacts` function is completed.
Threading has to be used to allow the progress bar to update as the `importContacts` method is running. +
**Alternative 2:** Show the user how many contacts have been added in `ResultDisplay`  +
**Pros:** Easy to implement as no new UI elements have to be added +
**Cons:** Not as user-friendly as having a progress bar +

---

**Aspect:** Implementation of authorization +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Pop-up the authorization page in the user's default browser +
**Pros:** Easy for the user to authorize as they may already be logged in to their Google account on their browsers. +
**Cons:** Takes the focus away from the main application to the user's default browser, which may be a jarring user experience. +
**Alternative 2:** Use the existing browser panel to show the authorization page +
**Pros:** Clearer for the user to understand and focus is kept on the main application. +
**Cons:** Requires implementing a new class to listen on the local web server for the authorization code instead of using the provided `LocalServerReceiver` from the Google Client Library. +

=== Export mechanism

The export mechanism is facilitated by java `File` and `FileOutputStream` class. It supports writing contact information into a vCard format file.
This file will be saved in the application data folder where user can import it into other applications such as Google Contacts.

Firstly, a `Vcard` object has be to created for every person that user wants to export. `Vcard` of each person contains a unique
String `cardDetails` that stores information about the person. The current version of vCard used is 3.0 as shown in the code example below:

* vCard format:
+
[source, java]
--------------
public Vcard(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
    requireNonNull(person);
    //get all information from the person
    cardDetails = "BEGIN:VCARD\n"
            + "VERSION:3.0\n"
            + "FN:" + name + "\n"
            + "TEL;TYPE=MOBILE:" + phone + "\n"
            + "EMAIL;TYPE=WORK:" + email + "\n"
            + "BDAY:" + birthday + "\n"
            + "ADR;TYPE=HOME:;;" + address + "\n"
            + "END:VCARD" + "\n";
}
--------------

Next, a `File` will be created. In order to store all the `cardDetails` created earlier, `FileOutputStream` will call its
method write to write and saved all information in the `File` named as "contacts.vcf". An example of how write method is execute is shown below:

* FileOutputStream write method: +
`cardDetails` are first encoded into a sequence of bytes and stored in a byte array, b.
`FileOutputStream` calls write(byte[] b) in order to write the encoded string into the file.

+
[source, java]
---------------
// Creating an instance of FileOutputStream
fos = new FileOutputStream(file);
// For each Vcard created earlier
    try {
        // FileOutputStream will write the string encoded as byte array into the file.
        fos.write(vCard.getCardDetails().getBytes());
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // Print exception
    }
}
---------------

Finally, the directory for the "contacts.vcf" will be shown to the user and the file can be imported to other applications.


=== Tag Edit
This feature is implemented to provide users the ability to edit tags without having to update each person one at a time.

The following sequence diagram shows how the tag edit operation works:

image::TagEditLogicDiagramv2.png[width="800"]

The user will have to provide the command `tagedit friends losers` to change all persons with the tag `friends` to the
tag `losers` in the address book. `TagEditCommandParser` will parse the 2 arguments given after `tagedit` (in this case,
they are `friends` and `losers`) provided by the user and it will return `TagEditCommand`. Next, `TagEditCommand`
will call its method `executeUndoableCommand()` and ensure that the tag `friends` specified is valid.

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Implementation of `TagEditCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** implement it by extending `UndoableCommand` +
**Pros:** Editing tags is undoable/redoable +
**Cons:** May be difficult for new developers to understand the flow +
**Alternative 2:** just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve template pattern, easier to understand +
**Cons:** Cannot undo/redo unless `super.execute()` is called

This feature is implemented as an improvement to the default `find` feature. Currently, the user is able to find
contacts based on a word in the name, tag, or both, without the need for prefixes as seen in the `add` or `edit`
features.

When using the search feature, there are 2 possible cases: +

**Case 1: User input contains only 1 argument** +
The user is searching either a keyword in the name OR a tag. Contacts with the matching name OR tag will be listed.

**Case 2: User input contains more than 1 argument** +
The user is searching for contacts with a keyword in the name AND a tag. Contacts with the matching name AND tag will
be listed.

The sequence diagram for the command `search Alex friends` is shown below:

image::SearchLogicDiagram.png[width="800"]

The user will have to provide the command `search Alex friends` to search for persons with the word `Alex` in their
names and the tag `friends` under their tags. `SearchCommandParser` will parse the 2 arguments given after `search`
(in this case, they are `Alex` and `friends`) provided by the user and it will return `SearchCommand`. In
`SearchCommand`, the method `PersonContainsKeywordsPredicate` will check the arguments provided against the existing
list of names and tags and return all persons with the matching keyword `Alex` in their names and tag `friends`.
Finally, `execute()` will run `updateFilteredPersonList` to show the list of persons returned.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
