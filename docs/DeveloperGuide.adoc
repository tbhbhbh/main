== Introduction

HitMeUp is an address book application designed with the sociable user in mind. It aims to provide a one stop solution for every need: To contact, keep up
and organise.
With the cloud import feature, a user would be able to get the application
up and running a matter of minutes. Being able to group your contacts, and view each group at a glance affords
convenience like never before. Social integration to Instagram and Twitter is baked in, allowing users to view profiles
in the application itself without having to switch to a browser or check their phone.

== About
This Developer Guide aims to provide comprehensive information to help both experienced and new developers who are interested in contributing to the
development of HitMeUp.

This Developer Guide will also explain some of the design patterns used to design HitMeUp. Moreover, it will cover some
of the underlying mechanism of certain features that are implemented as well as the different aspects of the implementation
considered by our development team.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer
To set up the project, please follow these following steps:

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer.
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first).
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`.
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK.
. Click `Import Project`.
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`.
. Click `Open as Project`.
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings.
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands.
. link:#testing[Run the tests] to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code
Before writing any code, set up the following configurations:

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/codingStandards/CodingStandard-Java.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS).
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`.
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order.

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements.
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`.

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform link:#ci[Continuous Integration] (CI) for your fork. Please refer to <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (Refer to <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based).

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding, please read the following:

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading the link:#architecture[Architecture] section.
2. Take a look at the section link:#suggested-programming-tasks-to-get-started[Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started].

== Design
The design patterns of the App is shown in the following sections:

=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
_Figure 2.1.1 : Architecture Diagram_

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for:

* Initializing the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other at app launch.
* Shutting down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

link:#common-classes[*`Commons`*] represents a collection of classes used by other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : This class is used by other classes to write log messages to App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* link:#ui-component[*`UI`*] : The UI of the App.
* link:#logic-component[*`Logic`*] : The command executor.
* link:#model-component[*`Model`*] : Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* link:#storage-component[*`Storage`*] : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components:

* Define its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Expose its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.2 : Class Diagram of the Logic Component_

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3a : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)_

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.1.3b : Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)_

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

=== UI component
With reference to the diagram below, the UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts such as `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel`. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit the abstract `UiPart` class.

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]


The `UI` component is able to:

* execute user commands using the `Logic` component.
* bind itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can update automatically when data in the `Model` changes.
* respond to events raised from various parts of the App and update the UI accordingly.

=== Logic component

The diagram below illustrates how the Logic uses `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Structure of the Logic Component_

The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

The figure below shows the finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in Figure 2.3.1.

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.2 : Structure of Commands in the Logic Component._

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

The `Logic` is able to:

* parse an input and create a `XYZCommand`
* execute a `XYZCommand` to produce a `CommandResult`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.3.1 : Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command_

=== Model component

The diagram below shows different components and interfaces in the `Model`.

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model` is able to:

* store a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* store the Address Book data.
* expose an unmodifiable `ObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* operate independently from the other three components.

=== Storage component

The diagram below shows different storage classes that store the App's data.

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 2.5.1 : Structure of the Storage Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component is able to:

* save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.
* copy chosen images into the storage

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo mechanism

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of the address book (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. The following diagram shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

As you can see from the diagram, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of the address book before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in the address book. The current state of the address book is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore the address book to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores the address book to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="200"]

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of `UndoableCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()` +
**Pros:** We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist. +
**Cons:** It will be hard for new developers to understand the template pattern. +
**Alternative 2:** Override `execute()` +
**Pros:** It does not involve the template pattern so that it is easier for new developers to understand. +
**Cons:** The classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()` or they will lose the ability to undo/redo.

---

**Aspect:** How undo & redo executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book +
**Pros:** It is easy to implement. +
**Cons:** It may have performance issues in terms of memory usage. +
**Alternative 2:** Undo/redo by itself in individual command +
**Pros:** It will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted). +
**Cons:** We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

**Aspect:** Types of command that can be undone/redone +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Include commands that modifies the address book (`add`, `clear`, `edit`) +
**Pros:** We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are lost). +
**Cons:** User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example). However, they will only realize that it does not do that after executing `undo`. +
**Alternative 2:** Include all commands +
**Pros:** It might be more intuitive for the user. +
**Cons:** User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address book and not the view. +
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].

---

**Aspect:** Data structure to support the undo/redo commands +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo +
**Pros:** It is easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project. +
**Cons:** The logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`. +
**Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo +
**Pros:** We do not need to maintain a separate stack and can reuse what is already in the codebase. +
**Cons:** It requires dealing with commands that have already been undone so we must remember to skip these commands. It violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things. +
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::email[]
=== Email mechanism

The email mechanism is facilitated by java `Desktop` class which allows java application to launch default mail application registered on the users' native desktop to handle a Uniform Resource Indentifier (link:#uri[URI]).
In this case, the URI is created with reference to the mail command scheme and email addresses to mail to.

==== Email command implementation

image::EmailCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

_Figure 3.2.1 Email Command Sequence Diagram_

From the diagram above, when users enter the command `email 1` to email a person in the contact list.
`EmailCommandParser` will parse the arguments, which is a single index provided by the user, and stores it
in an array called `targetIndices` before returning the `EmailCommand`.

Next, `EmailCommand` will call its method `execute()` as shown in the code segment below. It ensures that `Index` specified is valid
and also constructs a string `allEmailAddresses` which contains the email address specified. +

* Code listing:
+
[source, java]
-------------
public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
    List<ReadOnlyPerson> lastShownList = model.getFilteredPersonList();
    // Constructs a StringBuilder to append all the names and email addresses
    StringBuilder addresses = new StringBuilder();
    StringBuilder persons = new StringBuilder();
    for (Index targetIndex : targetIndices) {
        if (targetIndex.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) {
            // Throw exception for out of bounds index
        }
        ReadOnlyPerson personToEmail = lastShownList.get(targetIndex.getZeroBased());
        if (personToEmail.getEmail().toString().isEmpty()) {
            // Throws exception if personToEmail has no email address
        }
        // Concatenate the names and email addresses of each person
        persons.append(", " + personToEmail.getName().toString());
        addresses.append(" " + personToEmail.getEmail().toString());
    }

    String allPersons = StringUtil.removeCommaInFront(persons.toString());
    String allEmailAddresses = StringUtil.replaceWhiteSpaceWithComma(addresses.toString());

    // Post the EmailRequestEvent
    // Returns CommandResult to display all person that user wants to email
}

-------------
[NOTE]
The string `allEmailAddresses` is constructed by appending a comma after each email address of a contact. This is done to ensure that it follows the mailing scheme required when
constructing a `URI`.

==== Email request event process

image::EmailRequestEventSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

_Figure 5.2.1 Email Request Event Sequence Diagram_

With reference to the diagram above, after `EmailCommand` has executed, it will post a new `EmailRequestEvent` and allows the UI to handle this event. In the UI, we are using java `Desktop` class to
launch the default mail application registered on users' native desktop. A `URI` instance has to be created and pass to the mail method in the `Desktop` class.
Refer to the code example below: +

* Code listing:
+
[source, java]
--------------
private staic final String EMAIL_URI_PREFIX = "mailTo:";

public void handleEmail(String allEmailAddresses) {
    URI mailTo = null;
    try {
        // Creates a valid URI instance or throws an exception if syntax is wrong
        mailTo = new URI(EMAIL_URI_PREFIX + allEmailAddresses);
    } catch (URISyntaxException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    // Checks if Desktop operations can be supported
    if (Desktop.isDesktopSupported()) {
        // Creates a Desktop instance if it is supported
        Desktop userDesktop = Desktop.getDesktop();
        logger.info("Showing user's default mail application");
        try {
            // Desktop mail method will launch user default mail application
            userDesktop.mail(mailTo);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
--------------

[NOTE]
To construct a valid `URI` instance, the String `EMAIL_URI_PREFIX` which specifies the scheme to launch user's default mail application must be
followed by the String `allEmailAddresses`.

Lastly, users' desktop will launch a default mail application where they can compose the subject and message body of the email.
Moreover, users can also edit their recipients field to include carbon copy or blind carbon copy before sending out
the email to their recipients.

*Design Considerations*:

---

**Aspect:** Type of application to send emails +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use user's default mail application in their desktop +
**Pros:** The default mail application tends to load faster than the Javafx `WebView` used by the `BrowserPanel` in the `UI`. +
**Cons:** Some users may have set their default mail application as other applications such as web browser where they have to make changes before it can be used. +
**Alternative 2:** Use web browsers to access user email services online +
**Pros:** It is able to support more users as there are more options for different users using different email services. +
**Cons:** Since all users may not use the same email services such as link:#gmail[Gmail] or link:#outlook[Outlook],
it is difficult to authorize every email services as some services such as Gmail which requires link:#OAuth[OAuth 2.0 protocol] for authorization. +

---

**Aspect:** Type of API used +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `Desktop` API +
**Pros:** It allows user to format their messages using text editor in their default mail application. +
**Cons:** It does not require authentication if user has already configured their mail application so it may be misused if application is used by someone else.
On some platforms such as Linux, this API is dependent on the availability of the link:#gnome[Gnome libraries] as well.  +
**Alternative 2:** Use `JavaMail` API +
**Pros:** It is able to support most email services such as Outlook and also allows users to enter their message within the application itself. +
**Cons:** By entering username and password to authorize a session, there may be some security breaches if it is not encrypted properly.
// end::email[]

// tag::import[]
=== Import mechanism

The import mechanism is facilitated by Google's People API. It supports reading up to 1000 contacts from the user's personal Google account and parsing them into a format that can be added to the address book. The import mechanism only supports
adding contacts from Google but link:#icloud[iCloud] import is scheduled for release in a later version of the application.

Before any importing can be done, HitMeUp to be authorized to request data from Google's API. This is done using the OAuth 2.0 protocol as it is the standard used by Google for the People API.
As there are libraries from Google that handle authorization, these libraries have been used in the implementation of the import mechanism.

Client information such as the Client ID and Client secret are first loaded into a `GoogleClientSecrets` object. The client secrets are stored in a JSON file and since the executable will be distributed to users, as per
https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2InstalledApp[Google's OAuth documentation], the client secrets are not treated as a secret in this context. After which, A `GoogleAuthorizationCodeFlow` object is set up
using the `GoogleClientSecrets`, `HttpTransport`, `JsonFactory` objects and the scope of access desired to the user's Google Contacts data. In this implementation, we have chosen read-only as we are only importing
contacts and no modification to the user's data on Google will be performed. An `AuthorizationUtil` object is then created using the previously mentioned `GoogleAuthorizationCodeFlow` object, and also a `LocalServerReceiver` object which allows the application to listen on the local
web server for the authorization code that is provided when the user gives consent to access his/her data. The `AuthorizationUtil` inherits from `AuthorizationCodeInstalledApp` as the `browse` method was modified to allow for the authorization
URL to be opened in the `BrowserPanel`.

After which, the authorization flow can finally begin. The following sequence diagram illustrates this process.

image::https://developers.google.com/accounts/images/webflow.png[width="377"]
(Diagram from: https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2, reused under Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License)

A token is first requested by invoking the `authorize` method from `GoogleUtil` where an `AuthorizationUtil` loads the page for the user to login to his/her Google account in the `BrowserPanel`.
Once the user provides consent for the address book to access the data, an authorization code is sent back to the `LocalServerReceiver` object and passed on to the `GoogleAuthorizationCodeFlow`
object so that the code can be exchanged for a token. Once the token is received, a `Credential` object is created and returned to the `executeUndoableCommand` method.

The Credential object is then passed to a `retrieveContacts` method from `GoogleUtil` that creates a `PeopleService` object that allows the application to interact with Google's People API.
The parameters used to get the list of the user's connections (Google's term for contacts) are as follows:

----
PageSize: 1000
PersonFields: Names, EmailAddresses, PhoneNumbers, Addresses, Birthdays
----

A PageSize (the number of connections to fetch) of 1000 is chosen as it is the amount of contacts that the address book should be able to hold before it gets sluggish.
The PersonFields chosen are the ones most relevant to storing a contact in HitMeUp.

`retrieveContacts` will then pass the `List<Person>` of connections back to the caller and finally, the `importContacts` method will be called on the `List<Person>`.

Refer to the code example below for implementation of the `importContacts` method: +

* Code listing:
+
[source, java]
--------------
/**
  * Imports contacts into the application using the given {@code List<Person>}
  */
    public void importContacts(List<Person> connections) {

        Task<Void> task = new Task<Void>() {
            @Override
            protected Void call() throws Exception {

                int amountToAdd = connections.size();
                invalidPeople = new ArrayList<String>();
                for (Person person : connections) {
                    seedu.address.model.person.Person toAdd = GoogleUtil.convertPerson(person);
                    if (toAdd == null) {
                        invalidPeople.add(person.getNames().get(FIRST_PERSON_INDEX).getDisplayName());
                        continue;
                    }
                    try {
                        model.addPerson(toAdd);
                        peopleAdded++;
                    } catch (DuplicatePersonException e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    }
                    updateProgress(peopleAdded, amountToAdd);
                }
                return null;
            }
        };

        // housekeeping code for the start/end of the Task

The `importContacts` method is implemented using the `Task` class from JavaFX and takes care of importing contacts to the address book. `importContacts` is run in a separate `Thread` from the main program.
It parses every connection from the `List<Person>` using a `convertPerson` method in `GoogleUtil` that converts a `Person` object to a `seedu.address.model.person.Person` such that it can be added to the address book.
A progress bar for importing is also shown to the user, implemented using the `progressProperty()` method of the `Task` class.


The following sequence diagram shows how the import operation works:

image::ImportSequenceDiagram.png[width="1000"]

The import mechanism is built upon an `UndoableCommand`, which means that any changes made by the command can be easily reversed by calling the
`undo` command.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** How import executes +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Individually adds each contact. +
**Pros:** User is able to see each contact being added. +
**Cons:** Slower than adding retrieved contacts all at once as the data has to be written to disk every time a contact is added individually +
**Alternative 2:** Contacts are only added after every single `Person` is parsed +
**Pros:** Faster than adding as soon as each `Person` is parsed as data is written all at once, instead of multiple times +
**Cons:** Requires a new method `addAllInList` to be implemented in model, which only has limited use as import is the only command doing a batch
addition of contacts

---

**Aspect:** How import progress is shown to the user +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Show a pop-up progress window indicating how many contacts have been added +
**Pros:** Intuitive for the user to understand +
**Cons:** Difficult to implement as importing contacts takes a (relatively) long time and thus, blocks the JavaFX thread from updating the UI in a timely manner. As such, the progress bar will not be updated until the `importContacts` function is completed.
Threading has to be used to allow the progress bar to update as the `importContacts` method is running. +
**Alternative 2:** Show the user how many contacts have been added in `ResultDisplay`  +
**Pros:** Easy to implement as no new UI elements have to be added +
**Cons:** Not as user-friendly as having a progress bar +

---

**Aspect:** Implementation of authorization +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use the `BrowserPanel` to show the authorization page +
**Pros:** Clearer for the user to understand and focus is kept on the main application. +
**Cons:** Requires implementing a new class as modification to the existing classes provided by the Google Libraries is needed to allow for the +
authorization URL to be shown in the `BrowserPanel` +
**Alternative 2 :** Pop-up the authorization page in the user's default browser +
**Pros:** Easy for the user to authorize as they may already be logged in to their Google account on their browsers. +
**Cons:** Takes the focus away from the main application to the user's default browser, which may be a jarring user experience. +
// end::import[]

// tag::export[]
=== Export mechanism

The export mechanism is facilitated by java `File` and `FileOutputStream` classes. It supports writing contact information into a link:#vCard[vCard] by creating a vCard format file.
This file will be created and can be imported into other platforms such as Google Contacts.

image::vCardClassDiagram.png[width="400"]
_Figure 5.4 Vcard Class Diagram_

With reference to the class diagram of `Vcard` above, a `Vcard` object created is unique for every person that user wants to export. `Vcard` of each person contains a unique
String `cardDetails` that stores all information about the person such as `Name` and `Phone`.

The current version of vCard used is 3.0 as shown in the code example below:

* vCard format:
+
[source, java]
--------------
public Vcard(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
    requireNonNull(person);
    //get all information from the person
    cardDetails = "BEGIN:VCARD\n"
            + "VERSION:3.0\n"
            + "FN:" + name + "\n"
            + "TEL;TYPE=MOBILE:" + phone + "\n"
            + "EMAIL;TYPE=WORK:" + email + "\n"
            + "BDAY:" + birthday + "\n"
            + "ADR;TYPE=HOME:;;" + address + "\n"
            + "END:VCARD" + "\n";
}
--------------

[NOTE]
In vCard version 3.0, only `VERSION`, `BEGIN`, `FN` and `END` properties are required. Other properties can be optional.
In this case, the application is only exporting important information for each person.

Next, an instance of `File` will be created if it has not been created before. In order for the `File` to store all the `cardDetails` created earlier, `writeToFile` method
will use `FileOutputStream` to write and saved all `cardDetails` content into the `File` created.
The process of writing into the `File` is shown in the code segment below:

* Creating a `File` and writing to the `File`: +

[source, java]
---------------
// Creates a new vCard file using a default file directory and file name.
File file = new File(DEFAULT_FILE_DIR, DEFAULT_FILE_NAME);
try {
    createIfMissing(file);
} catch (IOException e) {
    // Print exception
}

// Creates the content to be written into the vCard file
StringBuilder content = new StringBuilder();
for (ReadOnlyPerson person : listToExport) {
    Vcard personCard = new Vcard(person);
    content.append(personCard.getCardDetails());
}

// Writes the content into the vCard file.
try {
    writeToFile(file, content.toString());
} catch (IOException e) {
    // Print exception
}
---------------
[NOTE]
The `DEFAULT_FILE_DIR` is the data folder found in the application directory and the `DEFAULT_FILE_NAME` is contacts.vcf.

Finally, the directory that stores the "contacts.vcf" file will be shown to the user and the file can be imported to other platforms that support vCard files.

*Design Considerations*:

---

**Aspect:** Type of file to create +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Creates vCard file +
**Pros:** It is more flexible with the types of data that can be stored. Some of these data include photos, multiple phone numbers and website information. +
**Cons:** It does not support importing of multiple contacts into applications such as Outlook. +
**Alternative 2:** Creates link:#csv[CSV] file +
**Pros:** It is more readable and allows easy manipulation of the data when used in spreadsheets such as link:#excel[Excel]. +
**Cons:** It lacks of standardization whereby there are no rules in defining how contacts information are being written or read by other programs. It does not support some programs such as iCloud as well.
// end::export[]

// tag::displayPic[]
=== Display Picture Mechanism
This feature is facilitated by javafx `FileChooser` and java `IO` class. It supports choosing of images from hard disk via a pop up and
copies the chosen image into the designated image storage folder indicated in `UserPref`. The chosen image will then be displayed
in the `GUI` for reference to the specific contact.

==== Display picture implementation
This section will discuss the implementation of the display picture feature. +

image::DisplayPicLogicSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.5.1 shows a sequence diagram of editing the display picture of a person_

From the diagram above, we can see that additional work is done at `ArgumentTokenizer` in order to get the final display picture path with resides in the designated display picture file directory. +
 +
Since `ArgumentTokenizer` is only called in `AddCommandParser` and `EditCommandParser`, writing `dp/` in other command will not cause the display picture feature to be called. +
 +
When `dp/` is present in the command, `getCurrentImgPath` will be called. This function returns the path of the image that the user want to set as his display picture. Afterwards,
`createUniqueDisplayName` will create a unique name for the image chosen by hashing all the other fields of the person.

[source, java]
---------------
private static String createUniqueDisplayPicName(ArgumentMultimap argMultimap, String currentImgPath, Prefix... prefixes) {
    String displayPicName = currentImgPath;
    for (Prefix prefix : prefixes) {
        displayPicName += argMultimap.getValue(prefix);
    }
    return String.valueOf(displayPicName.hashCode());
}
---------------

Since duplicated users cannot be added, by hashing all the fields of a person, we can ensure that a unique hashcode is created which will then be used as the filename for the image. +
This is to ensure that images in the display picture file folder will not be overwritten as files with same name will overwrite each other. +
 +
 Afterwards, `getFinalImgPath` will return the display picture file path that has been copied to the designated display picture folder. This path will be the value for the prefix `dp/`, which will be parsed into the respective command parsers.


==== Event processes for choosing and copying of display picture
This section will discuss the flow of events when users wants to select display pictures for their contacts.

image::SDforDisplayPic.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.5.2a shows the interaction between components for `edit 1 dp/` command (part 1)_

The above diagrams shows the series of event when `ArgumentTokenizer` detects the prefix `dp/`. +
The following code snippets will show how the events are posted within each methods:
[source, java]
---------------
private static String getCurrentImgPath() {
    FileChooserEvent fileChooserEvent = new FileChooserEvent();
    EventsCenter.getInstance().post(fileChooserEvent);
    return fileChooserEvent.getImgPath();
}
---------------
`getCurrentImgPath` posts the `FileChooserEvent` which will be handled by `UI` to retrieve the path of the chosen image for the display picture.

[source, java]
---------------
private static String getFinalImgPath(String hashedDisplayPicName, String imgPath) {
    NewImageEvent newImageEvent = new NewImageEvent(hashedDisplayPicName, imgPath);
    EventsCenter.getInstance().post(newImageEvent);
    return newImageEvent.getImagePath();
}
---------------
`getFinalImgPath` posts the `NewImageEvent` which will be handled by `Storage` to retrieve the final display picture path in the designated display picture directory. +
 +
 The following diagram shows how the the events posted previously are being handled: +

image::SDforDisplayPicHandling.png[width="800"]
_Figure 5.5.2b shows the interaction between components for `edit 1 dp/` command (part 2)_

When `FileChooserEvent` is posted, it will be handled by `UI` and the method `getDisplayPicPath` will be called.
[source, java]
---------------
private String getDisplayPicPath() {
    FileChooser fileChooser = new FileChooser();
    FileChooser.ExtensionFilter extFilter = new FileChooser.ExtensionFilter("PICTURE files", "*.jpg", "*.png");
    fileChooser.getExtensionFilters().add(extFilter);
    File selectedFile = fileChooser.showOpenDialog(primaryStage);
    if (selectedFile != null) {
        return selectedFile.getAbsolutePath();
    } else {
        return DEFAULT_DP;
    }
}
---------------
This method will initiate a pop up in the `GUI` of HitMeUp for the user to choose the image they want to use. Afterwards, it returns the absolute path of the chosen image.

Afterwards, `NewImageEvent` will be posted and handled by `Storage`, the method `copyImageFile` will be called.
[source, java]
----------------
public void copyImage(String currentImagePath, String imageName) throws IOException {
    File currentImage = new File(currentImagePath);
    BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(currentImage));
    createImageDir();
    String newImagePath = getImageFilePath(imageName);
    BufferedOutputStream bos = new BufferedOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(newImagePath));

    int data;

    while ((data = bis.read()) != -1) {
        bos.write(data);
    }

    bis.close();
    bos.close();
}
----------------
This method will copy the chosen image into the designated display picture storage folder and return the path to the copied image.
The returned path will be stored as the display picture value of a person.

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** When to implement the feature +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Prompts for display picture when parser detects `dp/` in `add` or `edit` commands +
**Pros:** Natural flow of event as users can decide to add a display picture while adding the person +
**Cons:** Much more complex implementation is needed as we have to intercept the parsing of `add` or `edit` commands to add information for display picture +
**Alternative 2:**  Have a separate command `DisplayPic [INDEX]` to select a display picture for the person at `INDEX` after adding the person +
**Pros:** Easier implementation as it is very similar to the existing `edit` command +
**Cons:** Troublesome as users will need 2 step to add a display picture for their contacts +

---

**Aspect:** How to select display picture +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a FileChooser and allow Users to select the file +
**Pros:** Convenient for users as  to select the file +
**Cons:** No longer a CLI interface +
**Cons:** Hard to deploy JUnit testing as there are not way to automate the choosing of files in FileChooser +
**Alternative 2:** Users find the path of the file themselves and add it into the command +
**Pros:** CLI interface +
**Cons:** Hard for users who are not tech-savvy to find know the path of the image file +

---

**Aspect:** How is chosen image made accessible in the storage +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Copying the chosen image into the designated storage path +
**Pros:** Image will still be present at original path for users to use the image +
**Cons:** Inefficient memory usage as duplicate copy of the same image is made +
**Alternative 2:** Moving the chosen image to the designated storage path +
**Pros:** Efficient memory usage as duplicate copies will not be created +
**Cons:** Users may have difficulty finding the chosen image for later use as they will be renamed to prevent overwriting of image in the designated storage +

---
// end::displayPic[]

// tag::tagdelete[]
=== Tag Delete
This feature is implemented to provide users the ability to delete tags without having to update each person at a time.

The following sequence diagram shows how the tag delete operation works:

image::TagDeleteSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The user will have to provide the command `tagdelete friends` to delete the tag `friends` from all persons in HitMeUp.
`TagDeleteCommandParser` will parse the argument given after `tagdelete` provided by the user and it will return
 `TagDeleteCommand`. Next, `TagDeleteCommand` will call its method `executeUndoableCommand()` and ensure that the tag
 `friends` specified is valid.

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** implementation of `TagDeleteCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** implement it by extending `UndoableCommand` +
**Pros:** Deleting tags is undoable/redoable +
**Cons:** May be difficult for new developers to understand the flow +
**Alternative 2:** just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve template pattern, easier to understand +
**Cons:** Cannot undo/redo unless `super.execute()` is called
// end::tagdelete[]

// tag::tagedit[]
=== Tag Edit
This feature is implemented to provide users the ability to edit tags without having to update each person one at a time.

The following sequence diagram shows how the tag edit operation works:

image::TagEditLogicDiagramv2.png[width="800"]

The user will have to provide the command `tagedit friends losers` to change all persons with the tag `friends` to the
tag `losers` in the address book. `TagEditCommandParser` will parse the 2 arguments given after `tagedit` (in this case,
they are `friends` and `losers`) provided by the user and it will return `TagEditCommand`. Next, `TagEditCommand`
will call its method `executeUndoableCommand()` and ensure that the tag `friends` specified is valid.

==== Design Considerations
**Aspect:** Implementation of `TagEditCommand` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** implement it by extending `UndoableCommand` +
**Pros:** Editing tags is undoable/redoable +
**Cons:** May be difficult for new developers to understand the flow +
**Alternative 2:** just override `execute()` +
**Pros:** Does not involve template pattern, easier to understand +
**Cons:** Cannot undo/redo unless `super.execute()` is called
// end::tagedit[]

// tag::find[]
=== Find
This feature is implemented as an improvement to the default `find` feature. Previously, the user was only able to find
names. Currently, the user is able to find contacts based on the name, tags or both, without the need for prefixes as
seen in the `add` or `edit`. The user is also able to find contacts based on an initial.
features.

When using the find feature, there are 2 possible cases: +

**Case 1: User input contains only 1 argument** +

In this case there would be 4 possibilities: +
1) The user is searching for the keyword in the name, +
2) The user is searching for the keyword in the tags, +
3) The user is searching for a particular birthday month, +
4) OR the user is searching for an initial in the names. +

Contacts with the matching name, tag, birthday month or initial will be listed.


**Case 2: User input contains more than 1 argument** +
The user is searching for contacts with a keyword in the name AND a tag. Contacts with the matching name AND tag will
be listed.

Note that `find` only supports searching with 1 name keyword.

In this case, the user is either searching for a name with multiple tags, or simply multiple tags.

The sequence diagram for the command `find Alex` is shown below:

image::FindCommandLogicDiagram.png[width="800"]

The user will have to provide the command `find Alex` to search for persons with the word `Alex` in their
names. `SearchCommandParser` will parse the argument given after `find` provided and it will return `FindCommand`. In
`FindCommand`, the method `PersonContainsKeywordsPredicate` will check the arguments provided against the existing
list of names and tags and return all persons with the matching keyword `Alex` in their names.
Finally, `execute()` will run `updateFilteredPersonList` to show the list of persons returned.

Take another find command, `find Alex colleagues` for example. The code listing for checking if a person returns true
for the find command stated is as shown: +

* Code listing:
+
[source, java]
    public boolean test(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
        clearMasterAndTagLists();
        //sets up the name and tags of the person for comparison
        setUpMasterList(person);
        if (keywords.size() == 1) {
            //To handle find when input is a single argument
            //...logic...
        }
        /* Case 3: more than 1 keyword
         * Only supports 1 name, but multiple tags
         * a) name + tag
         * b) tag + tag + tag...
         */
        return masterList.containsAll(keywordsLower);
    }

The user will have to provide the command `find Alex colleagues` to search for persons with the word `Alex` and the tag
`colleagues` in their names. `SearchCommandParser` will parse the argument given after `find` provided and it will
return `FindCommand`. In `FindCommand`, the method `PersonContainsKeywordsPredicate` will check the arguments provided
against the existing list of names and tags and return all persons with the matching keyword `Alex` in their names and
tag `friends`. Finally, `execute()` will run `updateFilteredPersonList` to show the list of persons returned.

==== Design Considerations
*Aspect:* How to input arguments for the command +
*Alternative 1 (current choice):* flexible input, no prefixes needed +
*Pros:* easy and simple to use for the users +
*Cons:* harder to implement and edit in future +
*Alternative 2:* require users to enter prefixes to use find +
*Pros:* easy and simple to implement +
*Cons:* inconvenient and inflexible for the users
// end::find[]

// tag::social[]
=== Social

This feature is a way for users to quickly access their contacts' social media profiles via the built in browser,
provided that they have their usernames stored. Currently, HitMeUp supports Twitter and Instagram.

The diagram below shows the sequence diagram of a typical social command:

image::SocialSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
pass:[<div align="center"><b>Figure 3.8.1 Social Command Implementation</b></div>]

As shown above, when the user enters the command `social 1 ig`, `SocialCommandParser` will parse the arguments which
are an index and the chosen social media platform and return a `SocialCommand`. `SocialCommand` will then check the type
of social media platform in the 2nd argument of the user input. In this case, the user input is `ig` for Instagram.
`SocialCommand` will call its method `execute()` and ensure that the `Index` and the chosen social media is valid before
posting a new `SocialRequestEvent` to the UI. In the UI, the `MainWindow` calls an instance of the `BrowserPanel` to
load the Instagram page of the person at index 1.

==== Design Considerations
*Aspect:* What the user input for social media field should be +
*Alternative 1 (current choice):* Use the same prefixes when adding person +
*Pros:* Feels intuitive since you add people with the prefixes `ig` and `tw` and therefore should be able to invoke
this command the same way +
*Cons:* New users might instinctively type in the full name Instagram and Twitter instead of using the aliases +
*Alternative 2:* Use the full name of the social media platform +
*Pros:* Might be natural for some people to type in the full name and is convenient since users type less into the CLI +
*Cons:* Might not make sense since you add people's social media into their details based on shortcuts and yet in this
command the full name of the chosen social media is required. +
// end::social[]

// tag::location[]
=== Location

The location command is facilitated by the `BrowserPanel` class. It allows HitMeUp to load any URL through the use of the general `ShowUrlEvent` class
that sends an event to the `MainWindow` class, which subsequently invokes the `handleShowUrlEvent` that allows the URL to be displayed in the `BrowserPanel`. The URL
in this context would be a Google Maps URL which contains the address of the contact at the index selected by the user.

The input from the user will first be parsed by the `LocationCommandParser` which will determine whether or not the command conforms to the expected format.

The following code snippet shows the `execute` method of the `LocationCommand` class:

* Code listing:
+
[source, java]
    public CommandResult execute() throws CommandException {
            List<ReadOnlyPerson> lastShownList = model.getFilteredPersonList();
            // Check if index is valid
            if (index.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) {
                throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_PERSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
            }
            // Check if Google is reachable
            if (!GoogleUtil.isReachable()) {
                throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_FAILURE);
            }
            ReadOnlyPerson current = lastShownList.get(index.getZeroBased());
            // Check if Person has an address
            if (current.getAddress().toString().length() == 0) {
                throw new CommandException(String.format(MESSAGE_NO_ADDRESS, current.getName().toString()));
            }
            String finalUrl = GOOGLE_MAPS_URL_PREFIX + parseAddressForUrl(current.getAddress());
            EventsCenter.getInstance().post(new ShowUrlEvent(finalUrl));
            return new CommandResult(String.format(MESSAGE_SUCCESS, current.getName().toString()));
        }

After the input is successfully parsed, the `userInput` is passed to the `LocationCommand` class where 3 important checks are performed. Firstly, the index that is input by the user is checked to ensure
that it does not exceed the length of the list that is currently shown to the user. Next, a check is performed to see if the Google website is up, otherwise the Google Maps URL
would fail to load. Lastly, a check on the person at the user's specified index is done to see if he or she has an address. Once these checks are done, the
`parseAddressForUrl` method of the `LocationCommand` class takes in the address of the person and appends it to a `GOOGLE_MAPS_URL_PREFIX` to build the final URL. This method is
included in the `LocationCommand` class to allow for higher cohesion as this is the only class that would need to parse an address into a Google Maps URL.



The following activity diagram summarizes the flow of the location command:

image::LocationActivityDiagram.png[width="800]

==== Design Considerations
*Aspect:* How the Google Maps URL is passed to the BrowserPanel +
*Alternative 1 (current choice):* Use a `showUrlEvent` to send the URL to the `MainWindow` subscriber +
*Pros:* Allows `LocationCommand` to be more cohesive as it does not need to have an extra method to deal with the logic +
for displaying a URL in the `BrowserPanel` +
*Cons:* `LocationCommand` class would be more coupled with the `EventsCenter` class as it relies on the event for its core functionality +
*Alternative 2:* Create a public method in `MainWindow` for showing a URL in the `BrowserPanel`  +
*Pros:* Easy to implement, only 1 method in `MainWindow` required and it is called from the `execute` method of `LocationCommand` +
*Cons:* Exposes functionality of `MainWindow` unnecessarily to other classes
// end::location[]



=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See link:#configuration[Configuration])
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

The examples of different logging levels are shown below:

* `SEVERE` : Indicates critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application.
* `WARNING` : Indicates that application can continue but with caution.
* `INFO` : Showing information of the noteworthy actions by the App.
* `FINE` : Showing details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging such as printing the actual list instead of just its size.

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

Please refer to <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

Please refer to <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format:

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]
_Figure 6.3 : Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome_

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests*: These are tests involving the GUI. They include:
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire application by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit Tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests*: These are tests not involving the GUI. They include:
..  _Unit Tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration Tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units which are assumed to be working. +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These tests are checking multiple code units as well as how they are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

Please refer to <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. Please refer to <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release:

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, HitMeUp depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than the following alternatives: +

* Include the relevant libraries in the repo but this will increase the repo size +
* Require developers to download those libraries manually but this will create extra work for developers
