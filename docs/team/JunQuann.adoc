== Project: AddressBook - Level 4
HitMeUp is an address book application designed with the sociable user in mind. It aims to provide a one stop solution for every need: To contact, keep up
and organise.
With the cloud import feature, a user would be able to get the application
up and running a matter of minutes. Being able to group your contacts, and view each group at a glance affords
convenience like never before. Social integration to Instagram and Twitter is baked in, allowing users to view profiles
in the application itself without having to switch to a browser or check their phone.
