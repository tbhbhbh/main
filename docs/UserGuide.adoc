== Introduction

HitMeUp is an address book application designed with the sociable user in mind. It aims to provide a one stop solution for every need: To contact, keep up
and organise.
With the cloud import feature, a user would be able to get the application
up and running a matter of minutes. Being able to group your contacts, and view each group at a glance affords
convenience like never before. Social integration to Instagram and Twitter is baked in, allowing users to view profiles
in the application itself without having to switch to a browser or check their phone.

== About

This User Guide provides detailed description of each feature that are available in HitMeUp.
Each feature has its own examples so that you can easily follow through.
As this is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application, being able to type should help you use HitMeUp without much difficulty.
Lastly, there will be a command summary which will provide you a quick overview of how each feature can be used.

== Quick Start
